Some of the code is inspired by the ideas presented below:

------

- The FXAA antialiasing is based on the implementation created by
Simon Rodriguez, modified to work on Intel chips.

Original work:
Lottes, T. (2009). Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA).
NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA, Feb.

- 2-pass blurring techniques are based on Builder's QOL Shaders implementation:

Original work:
Banks, D., & McCrindle, R. J. (2008). Visual eye disease simulator.
Proc. 7th ICDVRAT with ArtAbilitation, Maia, Portugal.

- Grass movement is based on the one used in Sildur's shaders.

- Enhanced ambient occlusion is based on Capt Tatsu's ambient occlusion used in
BSL Shaders:

- TAA is based on Erkaman's TAA simple implementation:

- Hash noise functions by Dave Hoskins:

- Grid noise by CeeJayDK

I am not a graphics developer, I made this shader out of curiosity and
my personal use, but I think it is good enough to be shared.

I have not copied (not exactly), but have tried to learn, adapt and modify
other people's ideas in favor of the shader.
