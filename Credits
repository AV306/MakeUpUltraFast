Some of the code that is part of this program is inspired by the ideas
presented below:

------

- The FXAA antialiasing is based on the implementation created by
Simon Rodriguez, modified to work on Intel chips.
http://blog.simonrodriguez.fr/articles/30-07-2016_implementing_fxaa.html

Original work:
Lottes, T. (2009). Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA).
NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA, Feb.

- 2-pass blurring techniques are based on Builder's QOL Shaders implementation:

Original work:
Banks, D., & McCrindle, R. J. (2008). Visual eye disease simulator.
Proc. 7th ICDVRAT with ArtAbilitation, Maia, Portugal.

- Grass movement is based on the one used in Sildur's shaders.
https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/

- The water shader is a modification and adaptation of the one
used in ProjectLUMA by DeDelner.
https://dedelner.net/projectluma/

- Enhanced ambient occlusion is based on Capt Tatsu's ambient occlusion used in
BSL Shaders:
https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/

- TAA is based on Erkaman's TAA simple implementation:
https://gist.github.com/Erkaman

- Hash functions by Dave Hoskins:

- Interleaved noise from:
"NEXT GENERATION POST PROCESSING IN CALL OF DUTY: ADVANCED WARFARE"
http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2014/index.html

I am not a graphics developer, I made this shader out of curiosity and
my personal use, but I think it is good enough to be shared.

I have not copied (unless explicitly stated), but have tried to learn,
adapt and modify other people's ideas in favor of the shader.
